- The semnatic-models module takes as Input the following things-
    - Image
    - Mask

- We need to run a script in order to convert JSON File to masks which would contain the ground truth labels.
- The script to run is createTrainIdLabelImgs.py in the following way:
    - createTrainIdLabelImgs <path-to-directory-with-jsons> <path-to-directory-for-output>
    - Different Annotations are made for the data
    - Currently the scipt works fine cityscapes dataset, we can generalize it for all datasets

- Make a new main file for running your model under different structures
- Follow the steps as stated in README.md for your model.

- Important:
    - Keras Versions isn't currently compatible with the image_classifiers module being used, hence warnngs would be popped
    - shape of the tensors:
        - Data : (NUM_IMAGES,IMG_HEIGHT,IMG_WIDTH,CHANNELS)
        - Mask : (NUM_IMAGES,IMG_HEIGHT,IMG_WIDTH,NO_OF_CLASSES) 
        - Use one-hot encoding for all the pixels
